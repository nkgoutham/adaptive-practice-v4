   * Metadata collection (title, grade, subject)  
   * File size and type validation (PDF, max 20MB)  
2. Text Extraction  
   * PDF.js library processes file in browser  
   * Page-by-page text content extraction  
   * Content stored in pdf\_pages table with page numbers  
3. AI Processing  
   * Edge function extract-concepts called with chapter ID  
   * OpenAI API analyzes content for key concepts  
   * Page ranges identified for each concept  
   * Misconception database populated

### **Question Generation Logic**

### **Adaptive Learning Algorithm**

1. Question Selection Matrix

Bloom Levels: \[Recall, Conceptual, Application, Analysis\]  
Difficulties: \[Easy, Medium, Hard\]

2.   
3. Progression Logic  
   * Correct Answer Path:  
     * Increase Bloom level at same difficulty  
     * If at max Bloom, increase difficulty and reset Bloom  
     * If at max both, maintain level  
   * Incorrect Answer Path:  
     * Decrease difficulty at same Bloom level  
     * If at min difficulty, decrease Bloom level  
     * If at min both, maintain level  
4. Mastery Determination  
   * Concept mastered when:  
     * ≥2 correct answers at Medium+ difficulty, OR  
     * ≥1 correct answer at Hard difficulty

### **Misconception System**

1. Tagging Process  
   * Incorrect options assigned misconception tags during generation  
   * Tags reference common educational misconceptions  
   * Database stores tag explanations for consistent messaging  
2. Explanation Generation  
   * Context-aware explanations generated per attempt  
   * Based on question content, selected option, and misconception type  
   * Fallback explanations for robustness  
3. Learning Support
